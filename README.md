# Edimax AC1750 Driver

The AC1750 USB3 adapter driver from Edimax patched to support newer kernels.

 * There is a branch per upstream version (4.3.21 at initial commit).
 * Only tested on whatever the current Archlinux amd64 kernel is (4.7.4 at initial commit).
 * I am not a kernel dev, there could still be issues.
