# Edimax AC1750 Driver

## *** NO LONGER MAINTAINED ***

Linux kernel module for the AC1750 USB3 adapter from Edimax patched to support newer kernels.

 * This repo has a branch per upstream version (4.3.21 at initial commit).
 * Only tested on whatever the current Archlinux amd64 kernel is (4.7.4 at initial commit).
 * I am not a kernel dev, there could still be issues.
 * Only tested using the Edimax Supplied drivers with the AC1750 adapter; however, may work with other RTL8814AU based devices - YMMV. 
 * Only tested on an up-to-date ArchLinux - it may or may not work on other distributions.
 * See AUR package: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/edimax_ac1750_8814au-dkms/
